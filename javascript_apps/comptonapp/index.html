    <p>
      Gamma-rays that undergo Compton scattering in a radiation detector without depositing their remaining energy through Photoelectric absorption in the same detector are undesirable in gamma-ray spectroscopy.  That is because without full energy deposition it is not possible to identify which isotope produced the gamma-ray.  The energy deposited in the detector is that transferred to the electron by the gamma-ray and is related to the scattering angle by the following equation {insert Compton scattering equation}.
      <br>
      Experimentally, a continuum of energies is observed corresponding to gamma-rays scattering across the angular range up to 180 degrees.  The “Compton Edge” is the maximum energy that can be deposited by a gamma-ray Compton scattering. Use the app to estimate the Compton edge for 57Co (122keV), 137Cs (662keV) and 60Co (1172keV and 1332keV).
